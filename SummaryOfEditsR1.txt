List of minor comments.
Example 3.8 : TLJ \to \mathcal{TLJ}

-We think this is meant for the second paragraph in Example 3.10. We have changed TLJ_\bullet to \mathcal{TLJ}(d)_\bullet to denote the planar algebra.

p.10, Example 2.10 : what is \Phi?

-\Phi: P_\bullet \to G_\bullet is a planar algebra embedding. For some reason, we forgot to say this, which makes the example extremely confusing. We've now added it.

(14) : I was thinking of E_n rather than e_n. According to me E_n and p_n are more or less the
same object (except maybe that E_n : L^2(M_n, Tr_n) \to L^2(M_{n−1}, Tr_{n−1}) \subset L^2(M_n, Tr_n) whereas p_n = i_{M_{n−1}\subset M_n} \circ E_n is an operator from L^2(M_n,Tr_n) to L^2(M_n,Tr_n), where i_{M_{n−1}\subset M_n} is the inclusion of M_{n−1} into M_n). In any case I guess anyone familiar with Jones basic construction understands your point.

-To us, E_n : M_n \to M_{n-1} is a conditional expectation, and p_n is an operator on L^2(M_n,\tr_n). You are correct that since the M_n are finite dimensional, one could make this identification if you identify M_{n-1} with its image in M_n. However, given these would be different in the infinite dimensional finite von Neumann algebra case, we feel it is better to distinguish the two, especially in light of Remark 3.5.

p.32, proof of Lemma 4.5 : I don’t think you defined the set C (is it the Pimsner-Popa
basis of A0 ⊂ A1 ?)

-Yes, this is correct. Sorry for the omission.
