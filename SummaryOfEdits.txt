Summary of edits to "The module embedding theorem via towers of algebras"

We would like to thank the referee for their helpful comments and their careful reading of the manuscript. We have implemented the requested changes, which we summarize below.

(1) Introduction : you are using a lot of terms from category theory. If it is not possible to avoid them, at least provide a good reference to get the relevant definitions.
(2) p.4, l.40 : The tower of algebra TLJ d is never properly defined in the manuscript. Please introduce it, since it plays a central role in the paper.
(3) p.4, l.41 : add that the graph is locally finite.
-done

(4) p.5, l.55 : mention that the strings don’t intersect the input disk.
-done
(5) p.6, l.5 : tangle T → tangle S.
-done

(6) p.10, l.4 : what is pv ? The projection on loops based at v ?
-p_v is the projection in G_{0,+} corresponding to v. It acts on G_{k,+} by projecting to loops based at v.

(7) p.10, example 2.10 : There is nothing wrong with the definition, but I wonder why you
need to add the inner disk 1, since the definition of Mv implies that the left white region is already colored v (in the original spin picture of the paper of Jones, I guess this is the one you are using here). What is the map Φ ?
-p_v is the first argument of Z_G(\tilde T), which corresponds to the 0-box labelled 1 in \tilde T. The original definition of Jones does not allow for all vertex labels in regions; rather the planar algebra is only 2-shaded. One gets an action of planar tangles by taking sums over states, in which regions are shaded by vertices. So we must explicitly shade the left-most region by v by adding this 0-box.

(8) p.11, l.5, l.13 : mj → fj
-f_j \to m_j

(9) p.11, l.12 : stands→ strands and fi instead of fj.
-done (m_i instead of f_j)

(10) p.11, l.18 : x → xi.
-x \to x_j

(11) p.12, l.10 : you have to put r instead of q in the right diagram
-done

(12) p.12, l.12 : what is C(r, s) ?
-Replaced by C(r→s)
(13) p.12, l.40 : can ”be” obtained
-fixed
(14) p.13, l.44 : is there any difference between pn and En ?
-Yes, e_n \in M_{n+1}, but p_n is the abstract Jones projection from the basic construction of M_{n-1}\subset M_n. 
TODO: explicitly state what p_n is.

(15) p.14, l.25 : why do you claim that y commute with ae1 ? (which is of course true assuming the claim you are proving). Another way to prove this claim is simply to use that aen−1enen−1b ⊂ Xn+1 = MnenMn, which directly implies y(aen−1enen−1b) = 0 by the fact Mn+1 = Yn+1 􏰀 MnenMn as direct sum of von Neumann algebras.
(16) p.14, l.53 : you did not mention how to unravel the graph. Maybe you could add a reference to explain it (or simply state the reflection formula, which is not so long to write down).
(17) p.15, l.36 : up to my knowledge, you did not define the fusion graph of a module C*- category
(18) p.15, Lemma 3.12 : is there any other relation between the principal graph of M and the one of P?
-Not that comes to mind.

(19) p.15, l.50 : introduce the Pimsner-Popa basis before or at least refer to Definition 3.13 
(20) p.16, l.7 : avoid introducing the operator J since there is no use of it later. There are already a lot of definitions.
(21) p.16, l.15 : Tr(\sum bb^*)
(22) p.16, l.38 : add that the graph is connected
(23) p.17, Remark 3.19 : This remark is true but a bit misleading. In general there is a general grading on the principal graph (using your notations, the degree of a vertex v being the component Yk in which it appeared), and this grading changes after truncation. In particular if the original principal graph was pointed, this is not the case anymore after truncation. It may be a good idea to mention it.
(24) p.17, l.32 : 1Mn → 1pMnp
-done
(25) p.18, l.31 : how do you apply M4 ? I couldn’t find a way to apply it due to the order of the multiplication enk . . . e(n+1)k−1. Or maybe you only mean ⊂ instead of = at the beginning of l.31 ?
On line 36, once again I don’t get how you get an equality. Before applying f(n−1)k+1+(k−1), (n−1)k+1
you have to apply the above diagram on M(n+1)k−1, which is not necessarily surjective (even if it is a posteriori).
(26) p.19, l.45 : Mention that you are embedding x in Mn+2i+j, since otherwise the number of strings don’t match.
(27) p.20, l.43 : I could not find any mention of ”Linking algebra” in [GLR85]. Please precise what you mean by this term, and provide a precise reference inside [GLR85].
(28) p.21, l.49 : ∥f∥2
-Done
(29) p.22, l.44 : in this equality you are using the diagrammatic formulation of the conditional expectation. It may be a good idea to mention the diagrammatic picture in the definition of a planar algebra or a Markov tower.
(30) p.24, l.51 : j ≥ k
(31) p.25 , L.20 : there is a k missing on top of a string.
(32) p.25, l.54 : could you mention the indices of both 1, in order to help the reader ?
(33) p. 26 l. 17-25-32-39 : I think there may be something wrong with the exponents of d. For example, in the second equality, adding 2j + i loops should turn di+j into d−j , or am I wrong ?
(34) p.28, l.17 : ”One now shows these two processes are mutually inverse up to dagger equivalence.” It looks like there is something missing after this sentence.
-Showing these are mutually inverse is left to the reader.
TODO: make more explicit.

(35) p.30, l.50 : I don’t think that the map is surjective. Maybe you mean an isomorphism on the shifted planar algebra ? (I think this is what you meant, given the following theorem).
(36) p.31, l.55 : how do you show that d−1 􏰁b∈B bΦ(x)b∗ corresponds to the right picture ?
(37) p.32, proof of (1) : I think some part of the proof could be simplified. First, since u ∈ N′p and p ≤ q as projections in N and q ∈ N∩N′, you can directly write u = qvqp with v ∈ N′ (you don’t need to assume u unitary and use isometries), and your u0 corresponds to qvq. Then, you can use your reasoning ”First, ... = u0mnpξ” to conclude that qvq ∈ qMq.
Since q ∈ N ⊂ M, this directly implies that u ∈ Mp.
(38) p.32, l.43 : delete ”we have”
(39) p.33 l.15 : A0 = pA0p is actually equivalent to the central support of p being 1A0
(40) p.37, l.55 (1): why is it clear that we can find k large enough such that the projection
has central support 1 ?
